                        <h4>Nikol</h4>

							BARCELONA, CATALUNYA, Spain <br>

						<p>Hello,
My name is Nicole and I work as a licensed tourist guide in Barcelona. <br>
I started my work in the tourism first as a Tour leader traveling around all Europe but after 10 years of wandering I decided that it was time to settle in, in my most favorite city in Europe and that is
Barcelona!!! <br>
My passion and also my studies is History and my hobby is Art and I am getting fascinated every time when I am walking along medieval castles or ancient sites!! Even my guests
see this and they are keep saying to me that I bring history to life!!! <br>
I love my job and I consider the day successful only when I see the faces of my guests smiling content. <br>
Now I have a long experience as a guide too and whether you focus in history, Art or just to get to know my city and have fun I am your perfect match</p>

					<p> TOUR GUIDE RESPONSE: Thank you Haryanto family ! It was a lovely day indeed . I will miss you all . Lots of hugs, Lydia </p>

				<div class="grid_4">
					<div class="text_content"><p>Lydia was prompt, helpful, extremely knowledgable about both Spanish and Catalan history and was able to help us see parts of the area we never would have found or understood on our own. As we were driving back she suggested a detour to a volcanic lake, enabling us to see parts of the area that weren't even mentioned on the tour. I have no problem recommending her enthusiastically. </p> </div>
					<h5> Laura Marshall United States</h5>
					<p>TOUR GUIDE RESPONSE: Thank you too ! I will cherish the moments with you </p>
